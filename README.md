### Terrence D. Jorgensen

I am an assistant professor of methods and statistics within the [Department of Child Development and Education](https://cde.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam](http://uva.nl/).  My areas of expertise primarily involve structural equation modeling (SEM), multilevel modeling, nonparametric methods, and modern missing data methods.  My methodological research interests include:

- psychometrics, e.g., testing measurement equivalence and detecting differential item functioning (DIF)
- resampling methods (permutation, bootstrap, Monte Carlo simulation)
- Bayesian inference
- planned missing data designs
- statistical programming

I use GitHub to maintain two R packages (`semTools` and `simsem`) and contribute to two other R packages (`lavaan` and `blavaan`), which are all devoted to SEM in R. 

I frequently teach workshops about how to use these software packages, for which I host materials here, copyrighted under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
