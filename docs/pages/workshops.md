## Structural Equation Modeling

The Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology [RECSM](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey) organizises winter and summer [methods schools](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/activities) at the [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/)
in Barcelona.  I regularly teach an introductory SEM course, as well as a course on longitudinal panel models.


## Multilevel Structural Equation Models Using the `lavaan` Package

I will teach this [post-conference workshop](https://multilevel.fss.uu.nl/course/post-conference-multilevel-sem/) for the [International Conference on Multilevel Analysis](https://multilevel.fss.uu.nl/) in April 2022.


## Measurement Invariance with Categorical Indicators

I have taught this workshop for:

- [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu)'s [Quantitative Methods Colloquium](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/graduate/programs/quantitative-methods/colloquium.php) in February 2019
- [Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://www.charite.de/en/)'s research group on [Patient Centered Outcomes Research](http://patient-centered-outcomes-research.org/) in February 2022


## SimSEM-in-R

I teach a series of seminars about running Monte Carlo simulations for structural equation models.  I have taught this workshop for:

- the [Psychology Department](https://www.ntnu.edu/psychology) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in May 2021
- the  [International Meeting](https://www.psychometricsociety.org/annual-meeting) of the [Psychometric Society](https://www.psychometricsociety.org/) (IMPS) as a [preconference short course](https://www.psychometricsociety.org/post/simsem-r-simulating-structural-equation-models-using-lavaan-and-simsem) in July 2022


## State-of-the-Art Methods for Handling Missing Data

I have taught variations of this workshop for:

- the 30th [annual convention](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions) for the Association for Psychological Science ([APS](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/)) in May 2018
- the Junior Researchers ([JURE](https://www.earli.org/jure)) of the European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction ([EARLI](https://www.earli.org/)) conference in July 2018
