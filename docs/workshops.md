# Workshops and Short Courses

If you are interested in hosting any of the workshops below, please [contact me](http://www.uva.nl/profile/t.d.jorgensen) for more information about my availability.  I am happy to make reasonable changes/additions based on the particular educational needs of your group.


## Structural Equation Modeling

The Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology [RECSM](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey) organizises winter and summer [methods schools](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/activities) at the [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/)
in Barcelona.  I regularly teach an introductory SEM course, as well as a course on longitudinal panel models.  Materials and recorded lectures are made available to registered attendees.


## Multilevel Structural Equation Models Using the `lavaan` Package

I will teach this [post-conference workshop](https://multilevel.fss.uu.nl/course/post-conference-multilevel-sem/) for the [International Conference on Multilevel Analysis](https://multilevel.fss.uu.nl/) in April 2022.

## State-of-the-Art Methods for Handling Missing Data

I have taught variations of this workshop for:

- the 30th [annual convention](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions) for the Association for Psychological Science ([APS](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/)) in May 2018
